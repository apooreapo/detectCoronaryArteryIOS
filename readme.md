This is an iOS application trying to classificate your ECG recordings from Apple
Watch as showing Coronary Artery Disease or not. 

The application uses a Deep Learning model to understand if the recording's quality is good, and then uses a Machine Learning model, by extracting some time,
frequency and non-linear features in order to classificate the recording as CAD
or non CAD.

The main application is inside diplomaThesis folder.

Some demos of the application can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-511izXddnM&t=3s and here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l9-f1rZ-tk&t=2s .
